Hi! I'm Tim Schneider (@T1mSchneider), a recent Data Science graduate from Arizona State University. I enjoy leveraging computers to process and analyze large datasets, turning data into actionable insights. My toolkit includes Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and I'm currently diving into TensorFlow for machine learning. You’ll find me sharing personal projects here, primarily focused on data analysis and automation.

I’m passionate about learning and tackling complex problems with the simplest, most efficient solutions. I'm actively keeping my SQL skills sharp, working on machine learning projects, learning PySpark, and exploring a new approach to analyzing running backs in football to enhance data-driven insights in sports analytics, while finding a role where I can make an impact through data.

Outside of tech, I’m a big sports fan—football and basketball are my favorites—and I love mountain biking. I’m always exploring new hobbies and challenges in my free time.
